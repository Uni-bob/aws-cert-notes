(Day 12)

## Amazon EC2 Basics

- EC2 is one of the most popular AWS services that they offer.
- EC2 stands for Elastic Compute Cloud, which = Infrastructure as a Service.
- EC2 is not just one service; it's composed of many.
- Mainly consists of the capability to:
  - Rent virtual machines (called EC2 instances)  
  - Store data on virtual drives (EBS volumes)  
  - Distribute load across machines (ELB – Elastic Load Balancer)  
  - Scale services using an auto-scaling group (ASG)

- Knowing EC2 is fundamental to understanding how the cloud works.
- The cloud is used to rent compute power on demand — and EC2 does just that.

## EC2 Sizing & Configuration Options

- Linux, Windows, macOS
- Compute power & number of cores (CPU)
- Amount of RAM
- Storage space:
  - Network-attached (EBS & EFS)
