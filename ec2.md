## Amazon EC2 Basics

- EC2 is one of the most popular AWS services that they offer.
- EC2 stands for Elastic Compute Cloud, which = Infrastructure as a Service.
- EC2 is not just one service; it's composed of many.
- Mainly consists of the capability to:
  - Rent virtual machines (called EC2 instances)  
  - Store data on virtual drives (EBS volumes)  
  - Distribute load across machines (ELB – Elastic Load Balancer)  
  - Scale services using an auto-scaling group (ASG)

- Knowing EC2 is fundamental to understanding how the cloud works.
- The cloud is used to rent compute power on demand — and EC2 does just that.

## EC2 Sizing & Configuration Options

- Linux, Windows, macOS
- Compute power & number of cores (CPU)
- Amount of RAM
- Storage space:
  - Network-attached (EBS & EFS)
  - Hardware (EC2 Instance Store)
- Network card: speed, public IP address
- Firewall rules: Security Group
- Bootstrap script (configured at first launch): EC2 User Data

(Day 13)

## EC2 User Data

- Bootstrapping means launching commands when a machine starts.
- It is possible to bootstrap our instances using an EC2 User Data script.
- That script is only run once at the instance's first start and will never be run again.
- EC2 User Data is used to automate boot tasks such as:
  - Installing updates and software
  - Downloading common files from the internet
  - Anything else you may think of
  - Keep in mind that the more you add to your data script, the longer your boot time will be.
- The EC2 User Data script runs with the root user. Therefore, any command you include will have "sudo" rights.

## (Hands-On) Launching EC2 Instance Running Linux

- When you stop an instance and later turn it on, it’s possible that Amazon may change the public IP address for your instance.
- The private IP will always stay the same.
